## Algorithm

- What is an algorithm?
    - A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.
    - Almost everything that you do in programning involves some kind of algorithm.

- How do you improve?
    1. Devise a plan for solving problems
    2. Master common problem solving patterns

## Problem Solving Strategies

1. Understand the Problem
1. Explore Concrete Examples
1. Break It Down
1. Solve/Simplify
1. Look Back and Refactor

### Step 1: Understand the problem

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? 
    - You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay, it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

### Step 2: Explore Concrete Examples

- Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better.
- Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should.
- User Stories!
- Unit Tests!

1. Start with Simple Examples
1. Progress to more complex examples
1. Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
1. Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs

### Step 3: Break It Down

- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take. 

### Step 4: Solve it or simplify

- Find the core difficult in what you are trying to do
- Temporarily ignroe that difficulty
- Write a simplied solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty back in

### Step 5: Look Back and Refactor

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
    - Mainly time complexity and space complexity
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solve this problem?
