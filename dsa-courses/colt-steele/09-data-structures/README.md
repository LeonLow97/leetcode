## What are Data Structures?

- Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
- Different data structures excel at different things.
  - Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.
- Different ways of storing the same type of data.

## Objectives

- Explain what a class is
- Understand how JavaScript implements the idea of classes.
- Define terms like abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- Use ES2015 classes to implement data structures.

## Class Methods

- Using `static` keyword to define a static method for a class.
- Static methods are called without instantiating their class and cannot be called through a class instance.
- Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application.

## `this` keyword

- Inside all of our instance methods and constructor, this keyword `this` refers to the object created from that class (also known as an **instance**).
